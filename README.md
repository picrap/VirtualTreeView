# VirtualTreeView
A WPF TreeView that actually supports virtualization.  
Works with .NET Framework 4.5.  

## How to use it

It is available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VirtualTreeView/).  
The source code includes a demonstration application, where both modes (content and binding) are showed, side-by-side to traditional `TreeView` control.

## It is complete?

### No

**No it is not complete**. Currently it has only the features I needed (which is showing items and let them live); all contributors are welcome. The goal is to have a complete and extensible tree view.
